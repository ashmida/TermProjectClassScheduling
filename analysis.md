# Introduction

CPU Scheduling is a process determining which process will execute first while another process is on hold or in waiting state due to insufficient of CPU resources. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system faster and efficient. This project focused on non-preemptive scheduling. In non-preemptive scheduling method, the CPU has been allocated to a specific process. 

# Consideration

There are several types of scheduling algorithms: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time, Priority Scheduling, Round Robin Scheduling and multilevel scheduling. For this project we have considered First Come First Serve(FCFS), Shortest Job First(SJF) and Priority Scheduling. 

# Analysis

## FCFS

Give an analysis of your algo and compare it with the other two

## SJF

Give an analysis of your algo and compare it with the other two

## Priority Scheduling

Give an analysis of your algo and compare it with the other two
